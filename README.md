# Welcome

TypeClasses defines general programmatic abstractions taken from Scala cats
and Haskell TypeClasses. Building on top of Traits, you can actually dispatch
on whether a type implements an abstraction or not, which enables
a function to a concretely dispatchable type.


# TODO describe how easy it is to define a flip_types definition for custom types
